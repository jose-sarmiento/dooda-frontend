## Reflection

  This is the project i made during my intership at Samjang Food Inc. I design it and built from scratch.
  
  Designing an apealing and modern looking website is challenging. I made two other design of this until i come up with this final design and my boss and i are satisfied with the end result.
  
  I decide to use react because it will become big soon. I have to make it scalable and react is my best choice. Integrating it to the backend will be very easy. 

  Overall, building this ecommerce project was fun. It really test my frontend UI/UX skills.
